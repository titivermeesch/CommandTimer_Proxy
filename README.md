# CommandTimer_Proxy

This is a bungeecord/velocity plugin that allows you to execute commands on your proxy by using CommandTimer on your spigot/paper server.

## Limitations

- Due to how bungeecord/velocity channels work, the command won't execute when nobody is on the proxy network. There are plans to address this in the future
